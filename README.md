# Product-Recommendation-System
We have created a product recommendation system using a machine learning library - Apyori of python.
This system shows the probability(in %) of customers to buy products that are frequently bought together.
In this project we have taken a dataset of a grocery store providing the data of transactions of a week that have 7051 rows and 20 columns.
We used association rule(apriori) to identify te trends of products brought together frequently by the customers. And use these trends to recommend products to customers to increase the sales of the store.
